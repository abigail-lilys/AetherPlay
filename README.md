# Local Web Game Player

Local Web Game Player runs compatible local HTML game exports directly in your
browser. It supports RPG Maker MV/MZ, WOLF RPG, TyranoScript, Construct 2 NW.js, and
Cocos Creator games. You can open a local
game folder or import a ZIP, then play without uploading game files to a
server.

## Use Case

Many RPG Maker, WOLF RPG, TyranoScript, Construct 2, and Cocos Creator games are
distributed as desktop applications. This app is useful when playing web
exports on Linux or macOS through a browser.

It can also help with language study. The text overlay makes game text easier to
select with browser tools such as the Yomitan extension. Yomitan is a separate
project and is not included with this app.

Compatibility can still vary when a game or plugin relies
on an API that the browser player does not emulate.

## App Flow

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Open a folder for a large game, or import a ZIP for a smaller portable game.
3. Make sure the folder or ZIP contains game `index.html`.
4. Wait while the app scans the folder or imports the ZIP.
5. Select the game from the library.
6. If a session folder says `not bound`, select it and choose the
   same folder again.
7. Play the game in the player area.
8. Use Focus if the game does not receive keyboard input.
9. Use Fullscreen when you want a larger play view.
10. Use Overlay to collect game text in a readable text log.
11. Use Show to make overlay text visible on top of the game.
12. Use Guard to stop chosen keys from going into the game.
13. Download saves from the library when you want to export save data.

## Web Export Examples

A compatible web export has an `index.html` entry point and all of the assets
needed by the game. RPG Maker MV/MZ exports usually contain folders such as
`js`, `img`, `audio`, and `data`.

Some games keep these files inside a `www` folder:

```text
GameFolder/
  www/
    index.html
    js/
    img/
    audio/
    data/
```

Other games use a flatter layout, often next to files such as `game.exe`:

```text
GameFolder/
  game.exe
  index.html
  js/
  img/
  audio/
  data/
```

TyranoScript exports commonly use this layout:

```text
GameFolder/
  index.html
  tyrano/
  data/
```

WOLF RPG games need a web export produced by [wolftools](https://github.com/popupie/wolftools).
Open the exported folder that contains `index.html`, `asset_manifest.json`, and the extracted game
assets. The player loads those assets individually as the game requests them.

Construct 2 NW.js exports commonly use this layout:

```text
GameFolder/
  index.html
  c2runtime.js
  data.js
  images/
  media/
```

Cocos Creator web exports commonly use this layout, sometimes nested in an
Electron application's `resources` directory:

```text
GameFolder/
  index.html
  application.js
  cocos-js/
  src/
  assets/
```

Desktop wrapper files such as Electron's `main.js`, `package.json`, and
`node_modules` are not needed for browser playback. The player automatically
uses browser storage for TyranoScript exports that were configured for desktop
file saves.

## Extracting Packaged Desktop Games

Extraction does not guarantee browser compatibility. Games that depend on
unsupported Electron or Node.js APIs may still fail. Password-encrypted archives
and DRM-protected packages are not supported. Standard RPG Maker MV/MZ encrypted
image and audio assets are supported when the export includes a usable
encryption key.

### NW.js games packaged as `package.nw`

The player does not extract `package.nw` automatically. A typical Construct 2
`package.nw` is a ZIP archive, so extract it into a new folder with an archive
tool or the command line:

```sh
unzip "/path/to/package.nw" -d "./nw_extract"
```

Open the extracted folder that directly contains `index.html`. Construct 2
exports normally also contain `c2runtime.js` and `data.js`. The player serves
the extracted images, audio, scripts, and other assets as separate files when
the game requests them; it does not load `package.nw` as one large asset.

### Electron games packaged as `app.asar`

Electron can bundle an application's source files into `app.asar`. The archive
is usually inside `Game.app/Contents/Resources` on macOS or the game's
`resources` folder on Windows. Packaged Linux applications commonly use the
same `resources` folder layout.

Extract the archive into a new folder without modifying the installed game:

```sh
pnpm dlx @electron/asar extract "/path/to/resources/app.asar" "./electron_extract"
```

The current [official `@electron/asar` CLI](https://github.com/electron/asar)
requires Node.js 22.12 or newer.

If `app.asar.unpacked` exists, copy its contents into the extracted folder while
preserving its subdirectories. Then find the folder containing a compatible web
entry point. For TyranoScript, look for `index.html`, `tyrano`, and `data`. For
RPG Maker MV or MZ, look for `index.html`, `js`, and `data`, sometimes inside a
`www` folder. Open that folder in Local Web Game Player.

### Games distributed as a packaged executable

Enigma Virtual Box can bundle a game's files into its Windows executable. The
[official `evbunpack` project](https://github.com/mos9527/evbunpack) provides a
command-line tool and prebuilt Windows releases for extracting these files.

Extract the executable into a new folder without modifying the original game:

```sh
evbunpack "/path/to/Game.exe" "./evb_extract"
```

In the extracted folder, look for the same web entry point and supporting
folders described above. The game files may be nested inside one or more
subdirectories; open the folder that directly contains `index.html`.

## Desktop API Compatibility

For extracted RPG Maker and NW.js games, the player provides
compatibility layers for common `path`, `fs`, `process`, `os`, `Buffer`,
`events`, `stream`, `util`, `url`, `querystring`, `assert`, `timers`,
`child_process`, NW.js, and Electron calls. CommonJS modules can be loaded from
the game folder or `node_modules`, including packages that use a
`package.json` `main` or string `browser` entry.

## Local Setup

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Build the app:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```sh
pnpm run preview
```

## Privacy

The app is built for your own local game files. This project does not provide
game files. Nothing is uploaded by this app or stored on a server.

This is a backendless static web app. It does not need a server database or user
accounts.

Your browser may still limit or clear storage based on its own settings. Export
your saves when you want to keep a backup outside the browser.

ZIP imports are stored in browser storage. Folder opens may be persistent when
the browser supports folder handles, or session-only when it only supports the
older folder picker.

This is an unofficial player for user provided web game exports. It is not
affiliated with or endorsed by Gotcha Gotcha Games, KADOKAWA, Degica, SmokingWOLF,
or the TyranoScript project.
